    * Changed map drawing.
    * A new gateway node has appeared.
    * Now connections are drawn around gateways
    * For nodes on the local network, a â€œpresumptive gateway is drawn, even if it was not noticed in the traceroute
    * Added HTTPS connection (to use your own certificate, replace cert.pem and key.pem in /usr/local/share/setezor)
    * Fixed deb installation
